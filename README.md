### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Analysis using NLP  
**Objective:**  
- Performed **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** on textual data (e.g., movie reviews, tweets).  
- Built a sentiment analysis model to classify text as **positive or negative**.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, WordCloud, Matplotlib  

**Key Steps:**  
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)  
- Vectorized text data using **TF-IDF**  
- Trained ML models for sentiment classification
